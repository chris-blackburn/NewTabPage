# My New Tab Page

A new tab page written in AngularJS for the front end. RESTful services for this NewTabPage (for saving profiles) will come after the front end is complete. My goal is to write the backend in Go, PHP with Slim, and Express.js. I use grunt to run local servers, tests, and deploy the page on to host systems. 

This version of the new tab page will feature locally stored preferences instead of fetching them from a database on every page load. The user will be able to export their preferences to a file and eventually to a server.
